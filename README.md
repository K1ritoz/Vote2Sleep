## üîÑ Events API

Vote2Sleep fires several custom events that other plugins can listen to:

@EventHandler
public void onPreSleepVote(PreSleepVoteEvent event) {
    if (someCondition) {
        event.setCancelled(true);
    }
}

// After a player votes
@EventHandler
public void onSleepVote(SleepVoteEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    World world = event.getWorld();
    int totalVotes = event.getTotalVotes();
}

// When a vote is removed
@EventHandler
public void onVoteRemoved(SleepVoteRemovedEvent event) {
    // Handle vote removal
}

// Before night is skipped (cancellable)
@EventHandler
public void onPreNightSkip(PreNightSkipEvent event) {
    List<SleepVote> votes = event.getVotes();
    // Can cancel the skip
}

// After night is skipped
@EventHandler
public void onNightSkip(NightSkipEvent event) {
    World world = event.getWorld();
    List<SleepVote> votes = event.getVotes();
}
```
